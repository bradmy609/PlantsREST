Java Springboot RESTful Server
==============

***A simple server made using the Java framework Springboot with Maven.***

**Author:** *Bradley J.M.*

This server populates a local H2 database. It includes a controller file that responds to various get requests, and one of each PUT, POST, and DELETE request. This project was made to help me learn the fundamentals of the Spring framework, to build a better intuition around Maven, and to gain exposure to the Java language in general.
